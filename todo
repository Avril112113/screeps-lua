Look into creating a custom FS so that Lua code can be updated without recompiling everything.
Lua: Probably good idea to handle when the creep runs outa resources to do a earlier return
	 Or if that isn't the issue, find and run the next task if one just finished
Lua: Repairing of structures, if no turret present, it's a creep task
Lua: Turret tasks
Probably should consider better practice with .cpp and .hpp. (I'm just really lazy)
