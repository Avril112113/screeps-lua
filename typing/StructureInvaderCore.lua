--- <p><img align="right" alt="" src="./Screeps Documentation_files/invaderCore.png"/></p> <p>This NPC structure is a control center of NPC Strongholds, and also rules all invaders in the sector. It spawns NPC defenders of the stronghold, refill towers, repairs structures. While it's alive, it will spawn invaders in all rooms in the same sector. It also contains some valuable resources inside, which you can loot from its ruin if you destroy the structure.</p> <p>An Invader Core has two lifetime stages: deploy stage and active stage. When it appears in a random room in the sector, it has <code>ticksToDeploy</code> property,public ramparts around it, and doesn't perform any actions. While in this stage it's invulnerable to attacks (has <code>EFFECT_INVULNERABILITY</code> enabled). When the <code>ticksToDeploy</code> timer is over, it spawns structures around it and startsspawning creeps, becomes vulnerable, and receives <code>EFFECT_COLLAPSE_TIMER</code> which will remove the stronghold when this timer is over.  </p> <p>An active Invader Core spawns level-0 Invader Cores in neutral neighbor rooms inside the sector. These lesser Invader Cores are spawnednear the room controller and don't perform any activity except reserving/attacking the controller. One Invader Core can spawn up to 42 lesser Coresduring its lifetime. </p> <table class="table gameplay-info"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Hits</strong></td><td>100,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Deploy time</strong></td><td>5,000 ticks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Active time</strong></td><td>75,000 ticks with 10% random variation</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lesser cores spawn interval</strong></td><td><b>Stronghold level 1</b>: 4000 ticks<br/><b>Stronghold level 2</b>: 3500 ticks<br/><b>Stronghold level 3</b>: 3000 ticks<br/><b>Stronghold level 4</b>: 2500 ticks<br/><b>Stronghold level 5</b>: 2000 ticks<br/></td></tr></tbody></table>
